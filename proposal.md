# MLB Lockout Reaction Project Proposal
by Leo Kasper
## Framing the Project

For those who didn't know, the MLB is currently in a lockout due to a failure to reach an agreement with the MLB Players Association, causing the first couple games of the season to be cancelled. For my research topic, I'd like to do an analysis of how MLB fans of different teams reacted to the lockout as a sort of study of team culture. A lot of people like to throw out generalizations, such as Yankees fans being gloaty or Blue Jays fans being super polite, and I think this lockout is a perfect opportunity to see how people truly respond to a negative situation on social media. 

I have been an on-and-off baseball fan my whole life, as my dad works in baseball. Going to games a lot, I have been able to experience the baseball cultures in a few different cities, and the differences always intrigued me. Recently, I have begun to browse baseball-related social media and have seen a lot of over-the-top reactionary posts from fans who are upset with the MLB for delaying the start of the season. 

I currently don't have any other relevant projects to compare to or use as a guide, but I plan to change that as I go on and do more research.

## Proposed Methodology

I believe that Reddit will be the best hub of discussion to examine in this case, as you can filter comments and posts not only through individual subreddits, but also through team flairs on the overall MLB subreddit. Scraping might also not be required for this as Reddit has API for this type of data collection. For things that cannot be achieved through the API, I will use Beautiful Soup. All of this should be collected in a Python script, and possibly put into Excel and looked at manually if I have things that I can't use Python to do.

I would like to build a website that displays my findings and has little blurbs about the statstics, using Pandas and NumPy to analyze and clean the data and other tools to create visualizations of the data.


## Plan of Action

I am at a very early planning stage for this project, but here's the outline of what I need to do:

- Research data collection methods and learn about Reddit API
- Determine scope of data collection and how it should be organized
- Write Python script to collect the data
- Perform analysis and create graphs and other visualizations to show differences, maybe use word clouds for each team
- Research tools to create a website, possibly something like Squarespace since I am not too familiar with web development
- Add images to the website and possibly interactive elements
- Do write ups for each section and an overall informational post about the project

This proposal is very short and to the point. I chose to be honest about where I'm at rather than try to cram at the last minute, but I believe with the remaining time in the semester I will be able to complete all the required research and output something unique, interesting, and informative.
