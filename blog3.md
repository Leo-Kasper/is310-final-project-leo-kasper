# 2/17/22 - Culture at Scale & Digital Collections

This was a really fun class to prepare for. I think that looking through any archival material is always interesting, whether it music, newspapers, or old web pages. The medium in which to display these archives digitally is something that I hadn't thought much on before doing the readings/explorations for this class, so it was very cool to be able to look through the Library of Congress Newspaper Navigator and play around with it.

The layout is simple, and has exactly what you need to make navigation quick and easy. Start year, end year, location, and keyword are the essential details you want to enter when searching for old newspapers and this makes it very easy. I enjoyed looking at old papers about technological developments in the early 1900s and seeing predictions for the future.
