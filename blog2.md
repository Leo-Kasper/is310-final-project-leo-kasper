# 3/29/22 - Revised Patterns and Outliers

Looking back on the "Seven ways humanists are using computers to understand text" reading from an end of the semester perspective is really interesting because we ended up doing a lot of the things that this article talks about in class or for my final project. It was a great way to introduce topics such as NLP in laymens terms before really digging deep into the actual code.

At the time I read this article, I was debating using word clouds as a main display for my final project results, but reading this article made me realize I need other things too. In my annotation I suggested that word clouds are only really useful if they are interactable, but I think that isn't necessarily true anymore. As long as you have sufficient text or other analyses to describe the context behind the word cloud, it is something worth considering in a report.
