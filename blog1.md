# 3/3/22 - GETting Data
I thought that the 'Haunted by Data' reading did a good job of describing an alternative perspective on data. Thinking of it as something akin to radioactive waste rather than a precious resource is very interesting because it shows how dangerous data collection can be. It builds and builds and you don't know what will happen to it or how it will be used later on. This is already beginning to happen as thanks to sites like The Way Back Machine, old deleted Tweets can resurface and people can be judged on things they said over a decade ago.

I think this is an interesting metaphor but I'm not sure how much I agree with the "Don't collect it, don't keep it, don't store it" bit at the end. I understand that this isn't meant to be a blanket statement about all data, but I think as things such as machine learning and trained algorithms grow in usefulness it may be useful to have lots of this "radioactive waste data" lying around to train said algorithms. If you care a lot about your privacy with certain things, that's fine, but I don't think random data points should necessarily be treated with the same level of caution as, say, a barrel of nuclear waste.
